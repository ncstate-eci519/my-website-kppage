                    <p class="card-text"> The instructional design project is the largest and most comprehensive project I have worked on to date. This was completed in the Fall of 2020 as part of the course Design and Evaluation of Instructional Materials. For the course, students worked in groups to complete an instructional design proposal for a problem of their choosing. The full project proposal required a synopsis of the project, a content analysis, a design blueprint, an evaluation plan and a web-prototype. I worked in a group of four to complete a project proposal focused on GSuite training for beginning teachers in the Mount Airy City School District, for which one group member was employed. I took on the role of team leader, organizing weekly group meetings, keeping group members on schedule and compiling final documents for submission. I was also responsible for creating and analyzing learning objectives, designing the evaluation plan and designing the layout of the web-prototype. The attached document is an excerpt of the full design proposal which includes the content analysis and evaluation plan. This project highlights my understanding of accepted pedagogy, instructional design principles, and appropriate assessment methods as well as my ability to work cooperatively with others. </p>

                      <p class="card-text"> This PlayPosit project was created in the Summer of 2020 as coursework for Teaching with Digital Video. The project required that I use PlayPosit to create interactions within a chosen video. This is a revision of a failed lesson my teammates and I taught during the first few months of pandemic remote learning. Originally, students watched the King Midas video then completed an assignment on the moral of the story. After reviewing student work, however, it was clear there were issues with work completion and work quality. For the purposes of this project, I took on the role of revising the lesson and embedded the assignment content within the video. This simple revision made it so students could not move forward without answering a question, but could go back and re-watch specific parts of the video if needed. This led to a dramatic improvement in both work quality and work completion when reassigned to students. This project showcases my ability to revise educational content as needed, as well as my ability to incorporate digital-age learning, such as videos, into lesson plans.</p>
