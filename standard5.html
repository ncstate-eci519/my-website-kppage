                    <p class="card-text"> This research was completed in the Summer of 2020 as coursework for Emerging Technologies. The project required that I research an emerging technology, analyze all sides and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of the emerging technology based on the literature. I conducted research on the future of learning analytics in education. This was an individual project for which I researched and wrote all parts. Attached is an excerpt of the final research report which includes the introduction, benefits of learning analytics, research findings, and research critiques. This project reflects my ability to stay abreast of current research and evaluate emerging technologies in order to make effective recommendations to all stakeholders regarding technology integration and implementation.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"> This project was completed in the Fall of 2019 as part of an introductory course to Learning Design and Technology. The project required students to conduct research on a topic of their choosing and compile findings in an annotated bibliography. I chose to research the "digital divide" in educational technology applications and found a majority of research in the past decade has shown technology use can widen student achievement gaps when staff is not given proper training by a technology facilitator. This project demonstrates my ability to research not only about emerging technologies, but the impact technology has on student achievement. This competency will allow me to make the best recommendations for technology implementation in the future.</p>
