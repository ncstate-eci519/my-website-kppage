    <h2>Emerging Technology Research</h2>

        <p>This research was completed in the Summer of 2020 as coursework for Emerging Technologies. The project required that I research an emerging technology, analyze all sides and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of the emerging technology based on the literature. I conducted research on the future of learning analytics in education. This was an individual project for which I researched and wrote all parts. Attached is an excerpt of the final research report which includes the introduction, benefits of learning analytics, research findings, and research critiques. This project reflects my ability to stay abreast of current research and evaluate emerging technologies in order to make effective recommendations to all stakeholders regarding technology integration and implementation.</p>
