                    <p class="card-text"> As part of my final semester in the Learning Design and Technology Program, I was tasked with completing a project in my chosen field of study. Parameters for the project were intentionally vague, giving students the freedom to choose, design, and complete a project that would showcase relevant competencies. For this project, since my school is without a technology teacher or technology facilitator and teachers are currently instructing remotely, I chose to complete technology coaching cycles with three teachers in my school who demonstrated a myriad of coaching needs from novice to expert. This project was completed over the course of a 16-week semester where I designed all aspects of the project and made all decisions regarding content and coaching needs. Attached is an excerpt of the final report which focuses on teacher A, a beginner with technology integration. The report includes notes from an initial interview, an initial observation, a model lesson, one coaching session, one co-teaching session and a final observation. Additionally, student engagement data was collected and analyzed to evaluate the impact of technology coaching. This project highlights my ability to design and deliver effective differentiated instruction for teachers while monitoring data for changes in teacher behavior and student achievement, a pillar of standard 1.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"> In the summer of 2020, just before the start of a new school year in which teachers learned they would be teaching remotely instead of in-person, I was approached by my principal and asked to create professional development on effective teaching strategies in the virtual elementary environment. Parameters given for the project were that it would be delivered to the entire staff, could be no more than an hour, and must address virtual teaching best practices for elementary students. Working with a timeline of two weeks, and utilizing the skills I obtained in the Learning Design and Technology program, I researched, designed, and delivered this professional development to the entire staff at my school. It was so well-received, I was asked to present the same professional development for a neighboring elementary school. At this time, over 75 teachers, administrators, and support staff have participated in this training. The content was informed by an article written by J. Savery titled "BE VOCAL: Characteristics of Successful Online Instructors" published in the Journal of Interactive Online Learning. However, the pacing, design and delivery of content was my own and articulates my ability to evaluate and recommend technology tools and resources based on best practices.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"> This project was completed in the Fall Semester of 2019 as part of an introductory course to Learning Design and Technology. I was charged with creating professional development by way of video for a technology tool of my choice. The criteria for the project were that it could be no longer than one hour and must be of high quality (as close to professional as our technology would allow). I chose to complete this professional development on EduCreations, an interactive whiteboard and screen casting tool that is valuable in the classroom, particularly for teachers using the flipped model of instruction. I was responsible for all aspects of this project including script writing, recording, video editing, compiling, and delivery. All components are original and showcase my ability to model and provide professional development on the integration of technology tools and resources in lessons.</p>
