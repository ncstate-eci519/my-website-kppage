                    <p class="card-text"> As part of my final semester in the Learning Design and Technology Program, I was tasked with completing a project in my chosen field of study. Parameters for the project were intentionally vague, giving students the freedom to choose, design, and complete a project that would showcase relevant competencies. For this project, since my school is without a technology teacher or technology facilitator and teachers are currently instructing remotely, I chose to complete technology coaching cycles with three teachers in my school who demonstrated a myriad of coaching needs from novice to expert. This project was completed over the course of a 16-week semester where I designed all aspects of the project and made all decisions regarding content and coaching needs. Attached is an excerpt of the final report which focuses on teacher A, a beginner with technology integration. The report includes notes from an initial interview, an initial observation, a model lesson, one coaching session, one co-teaching session and a final observation. Additionally, student engagement data was collected and analyzed to evaluate the impact of technology coaching. This project highlights my ability to design and deliver effective differentiated instruction for teachers while monitoring data for changes in teacher behavior and student achievement, a pillar of standard 1.</p>
