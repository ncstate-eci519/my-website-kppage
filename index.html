            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Kaitlin Page and I am currently a 4th grade teacher
                    at Willow Springs Elementary School in Wake County. I have been teaching 
                    for the last 10 years and during that time I have developed a love of 
                    technology integration in the classroom. This passion led me to apply 
                    to the <em>Learning Design and Technology</em> program at NCSU in 2019.
                    For the past two years, I have grown my professional knowledge and intend
                    to seek employment as a district technology facilitator upon my graduation
                    in May. My hope is to coach educators in technology integration to increase
                    student achievement and decrease teacher workload.  </p>

            <h2>Favorite Edtech Tools</h2>
                    <h3>GSuite</h3>
                        <p>Above all, my favorite edtech tool is GSuite for education.
                            Although there are many tools that are more groundbreaking, I 
                            see GSuite as a teacher's "bread and butter". It is easy to learn,
                            use, and implement with students of all ages in the classroom. <strong>It not
                            only encourages collaboration between students, but also allows 
                            teachers to work smarter, not harder</strong>. Some of my favorite activities to
                            implement with GSuite tools are: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Interactive learning with Jamboard (especially during breakout rooms during remote learning)</li>
                                    <li>Collaborative writing revision with Google Docs</li>
                                    <li>Instant feedback on assignments and homework through Google Forms</li>
                                    <li>Choose-your-own-adventure math challenges through Google Slides or Google Forms</li>
                                </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h3>Nearpod</h3>
                        <p>Nearpod has been a life-saver during COVID-19 remote learning. <strong>It allows teachers to create 
                            and deliver engaging, interactive lessons for students while also monitoring student engagement 
                            and understanding throughout each lesson</strong>. A new feature also allows teachers to embed questions 
                            within video to ensure students interact with and understanding video content when learning
                            independently. My favoritie features of Nearpod are: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Student data pops up in real-time showing the teacher how each student answered questions,
                                        allowing for quick intervention as necessary</li>
                                    <li>Teachers can control the pace of lessons so students are unable to move ahead until ready</li>
                                    <li>There is a vast library of pre-created content allowing teachers to save time</li>
                                </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h3>Flipgrid</h3>
                        <p>Flipgrid has been another pivotal tool during remote learning, especially in the elementary classroom. <strong>It 
                            is a discussion-based platform that allows students and teachers to create and respond to video content</strong>. 
                            The intuative design and built-in backgrounds/decorations make it easy and fun for students of all ages to engage.
                            The possibilites are endless, but some of my favorite activities are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Book reviews and novel discussions</li>
                                    <li>Oral reading fluency recordings and feedback</li>
                                    <li>Newscastings integrating science standards</li>
                                    <li>Explain-your-thinking math debates</li>
                                </ul>
                                <hr>
