            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>In the state of North Carolina, Instructional Technology Facilitators (ITFs) are integral to the development, design, implementation and evaluation of technology and technology programs in school districts. ITFs work with a myriad of stakeholders from students and teachers to administrators and superintendents to ensure all learners receive an equitable education that will prepare them for the 21st century. The North Carolina Educator Effectiveness System (NCEES) rubric provides a clear set of standards and competencies that are essential for ITFs to possess in order to be successful and effective. Upon review, this portfolio will demonstrate I have acquired all the necessary competencies of an effective ITF as measured by the NCEES evaluation rubric. To navigate the portfolio, use the drop-down menu in the upper right-hand corner to view artifacts grouped by standard. To return home, click the artifacts link beside the dropdown menu.</p>

                <p>Standard 1 of the NCEES ITF evaluation rubric states “Instructional Technology Facilitators demonstrate leadership”. Competencies for this standard focus on the design and delivery of differentiated professional development through coaching, co-teaching and mentoring as well as modeling lessons that demonstrate technology enabled teaching. The artifacts presented under standard 1 will demonstrate my strengths in designing and delivering both school-wide and individual professional development based on learner needs. Artifacts incorporated in this section include an excerpt from one-on-one technology coaching sessions, a training session on effective teaching in the virtual classroom, and video professional development on an interactive whiteboard and screencasting tool called EduCreations. 
                </p>

                <p>Standard 2 of the NCEES ITF evaluation rubric states “Instructional Technology Facilitators build a learning environment that meets the instructional needs of all students”. Competencies for this standard focus on the integration of global perspectives into lessons, reviewing and refining educational programs based on student needs, and implementing Universal Design to meet the needs of all learners. The artifacts presented under standard 2 will demonstrate my strengths in promoting global awareness, refining educational materials for the needs of all students, and the utilization of Universal Design. Artifacts incorporated in this section include a sample of a global project plan that integrates technology and social studies standards while connecting U.S. students with students from China to discuss global environmental issues, a Scratch game created based on the needs of teachers to serve under-performing students, and a sample lesson plan utilizing components of Universal Design. 
                </p>

                <p>Standard 3 of the NCEES ITF evaluation rubric states “Instructional Technology Facilitators facilitate the implementation of a comprehensive 21st century instructional technology program”. Competencies for this standard focus on integrating inquiry-based instruction, modeling effective use of new and innovative technologies and ensuring technology is used safely and appropriately. The artifacts presented under standard 3 will demonstrate my strengths in facilitating a 21st century learning plan that includes inquiry based instruction and internet safety. Artifacts incorporated in this section include an internet security video focusing on how to create safe passwords, and an advanced professional development video demonstrating how to integrate Scratch and Makey Makey to facilitate 21st century learning and thinking in the classroom as well as in makerspaces. 
                </p>

                <p>Standard 4 of the NCEES ITF evaluation rubric states “Instructional Technology Facilitators demonstrate knowledge of learners and learning and promote effective instructional practices in a 21st century learning environment”. Competencies for this standard focus on the understanding and facilitation of accepted pedagogy, instructional design principles, appropriate assessment methods, and the integration of digital-age learning experiences. The artifacts presented under standard 4 will demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of instructional design principles as well as my ability to use digital-age technology, such as video, to create dynamic learning experiences for all students. Artifacts incorporated in this section include an excerpt of a large instructional design project that proposed GSuite training for beginning teachers, as well as a revised lesson using PlayPosit video interaction. 
                </p>

                <p>Standard 5 of the NCEES ITF evaluation rubric states “Instructional Technology Facilitators actively reflect on their practice”. Competencies for this standard focus reflection and research on current and emerging technologies. The artifacts presented under standard 5 will demonstrate my research strengths and ability to make research-based recommendations for technology implementation. Artifacts incorporated in this section include an excerpt of a large research paper on the future of learning analytics in education, and an annotated bibliography on the digital divide in educational technology applications.
