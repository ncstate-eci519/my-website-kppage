                    <p class="card-text">In the state of North Carolina, Instructional Technology Facilitators (ITFs) are integral to the development, design, implementation and evaluation of technology and technology programs in school districts. ITFs work with a myriad of stakeholders from students and teachers to administrators and superintendents to ensure all learners receive an equitable education that will prepare them for the 21st century. The North Carolina Educator Effectiveness System (NCEES) rubric provides a clear set of standards and competencies that are essential for ITFs to possess in order to be successful and effective. Upon review, this portfolio will demonstrate I have acquired all the necessary competencies of an effective ITF as measured by the NCEES evaluation rubric. To navigate the portfolio, use the drop-down menu in the upper right-hand corner to view artifacts grouped by standard.
